# Tutorial: Add a new task

In this tutorial, you learn the operations to return a list of tasks with the same title.

Expect this tutorial to take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Make sure you've completed the [Before you start a tutorial](before-you-start-a-tutorial) topic on the development system you'll use for the tutorial.

## Get tasks by title

Returning a list of tasks from the service requires you to perform a get (`GET`) request on the [`task`](../api/task) resources in the service.

To get tasks by their title:

1. Make sure your local service is running, or start it by using this command, if it's not.

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
    json-server -w to-do-db-source.json
    ```

1. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
1. In the Postman app, create a new request with these values:
    * **METHOD**: GET
    * **URL**: `{{base_url}}/tasks/title`
    * **Headers**:
        * `Content-Type: application/json`

1. In the Postman app, select **Send** to make the request.
1. Watch for the response body, which should look something like this:

    ```js
    {
        "user_id": 3,
        "title": "Get new tires",
        "description": "Get new tires for Hoppity",
        "due_date": "2024-03-11T14:00",
        "warning": "-60",
        "id": 5
    }
    ```
