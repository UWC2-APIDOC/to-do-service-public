## API reference docs

The API reference docs below contain descriptions of the service's resources.

* [user resource](api/user)
* [task resource](api/task)

**Note:** The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service. When running a local test, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.
