# To-Do service API overview

The To-Do service is a simple yet powerful cloud-based REST API interface for helping busy people stay on track with their obligations and manage their schedules. If, for example, your days are filled with meetings and parenting duties, the To-Do service can ease your mind from worries about missing anything important.

With the To-Do service, adding a user profile takes only a minute. You can then easily add tasks to their profile. Task properties can include automatic reminders, detailed task descriptions, and warning level information. Users can access the list of tasks assigned to them at any time.

Devolopers can apply their own branding and integrate additional services to the app. The To-Do service is also great for integrating into any website that could benefit from automated reminders.
