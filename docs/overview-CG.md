# To-Do service

Your customers will never miss an appointment again! Our cloud-hosted task management service lets users stay organized effortlessly by managing tasks and scheduling appointments seamlessly in one place. Users can add tasks, retrieve tasks by property, set reminders, and more.

You do not need an API key to use our service. The API uses JSON to encode objects and relies on standard HTTP requests to manage `users` and `tasks`. It can even be integrated with your preferred calendar to make the ultimate productivity planner.
