# To-Do service API

This is a mock API to simulate the REST interface of an
imaginary service.

The To-Do service provides a cloud-hosted task list through which
subscribers can post tasks and receive reminders of those tasks.

## Quickstart

[Post your first task _(coming soon)_](#quickstart) with the To-Do service to see how easy it is to use!

## API reference docs

Detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When running a local test, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.

* [Get tasks by title](tasks-get-tasks-by-title)
